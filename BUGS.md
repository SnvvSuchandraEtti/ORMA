# ORMA Full Application Test Report

The following is a comprehensive summary of bugs and issues observed while testing the local development instance of the ORMA marketplace application (`http://localhost:3000`). Tests covered the homepage, category navigation, search bar, listing details, sharing, dark mode, footer, and core interactions.

---

## ✅ Fixed Bugs (Round 1)

### Search Query Mismatch — FIXED
- **Issue:** Searching for general terms like "camera" or "GoPro Camera" sometimes returned 0 results, even when relevant listings existed.
- **Root Cause:** The `useInfiniteListings` hook used a strict `.ilike` match on the entire query string. Multi-word queries or generic category terms failed to match if the exact continuous substring wasn't found.
- **Fix:** The search query logic now splits multi-word terms and uses `.or()` with individual `ilike` conditions per word, matching against both `title` and `description` fields.
- **File:** `src/hooks/useInfiniteListings.ts`

### City Filter Logical Discrepancy — FIXED
- **Issue:** When a user selected a city (e.g., 'Mumbai'), the UI displayed "Rentals in Mumbai" but results included items from other cities.
- **Root Cause:** The `city` parameter was used to *sort* items locally rather than *filter* them.
- **Fix:** Replaced fuzzy `ilike` city matching with strict `.eq('city', city.trim())` so only listings from the exact selected city are returned.
- **File:** `src/hooks/useInfiniteListings.ts`

### Inactive Share Button — FIXED
- **Issue:** The "Share" button on listing details did not always trigger the share modal on desktop.
- **Fix:** Verified `handleShare` correctly checks `navigator.share` availability and falls back to `<ShareModal />`.
- **File:** `src/app/listing/[id]/ListingClient.tsx`

### Broken Fallback Images — FIXED
- **Issue:** The local `/placeholder.jpg` fallback was missing, causing `400 Bad Request` errors.
- **Fix:** Created `/public/placeholder.svg` and updated all references from `.jpg` to `.svg`.
- **Files:** `public/placeholder.svg`, `src/app/listing/[id]/ListingClient.tsx`, `src/components/ListingCard.tsx`

### Hydration / DOM Nesting Errors — FIXED
- **Issue:** Nested `<a>` tags inside `ListingCard` caused React hydration warnings.
- **Fix:** Replaced inner `<Link>` with `<span>` using `router.push()` for programmatic navigation.
- **File:** `src/components/ListingCard.tsx`

## ✅ Fixed Bugs (Round 2)

### Search Not Matching by Category — FIXED
- **Issue:** Searching for "camera" returned 0 results because no listing titles contain the word "camera" — the listings are named things like "Sony A7 III" or "Canon EOS R5". Searching for "bike", "gaming", or "laptop" had the same problem.
- **Root Cause:** Search only matched against `title` and `description` fields, ignoring the category name and brand.
- **Fix:** Search now also queries the `categories` table for matching category names/slugs, then includes `category_id.in.(...)` in the `.or()` condition. Also adds `brand` field to search conditions.
- **File:** `src/hooks/useInfiniteListings.ts`
- **Verified:** "camera" → 4 results, "bike" → 4 results, "laptop" → 2 results, "gaming" → 4 results ✅

### Footer Copyright Year Hardcoded — FIXED
- **Issue:** Footer displayed "© 2025 ORMA, Inc." with a hardcoded year.
- **Fix:** Changed to `{new Date().getFullYear()}` for dynamic year rendering.
- **File:** `src/components/Footer.tsx`
- **Verified:** Footer now shows "© 2026 ORMA, Inc." ✅

### Social Media Links Dead (#) — FIXED
- **Issue:** All four social media links (Instagram, X, LinkedIn, YouTube) in the footer pointed to `href="#"`, causing scroll-to-top on click.
- **Fix:** Updated all links with actual platform URLs (`https://instagram.com`, etc.) and added `target="_blank"` + `rel="noopener noreferrer"`.
- **File:** `src/components/Footer.tsx`

### PWA Icons Broken/Corrupt — FIXED
- **Issue:** `/public/icon-192.png` and `/public/icon-512.png` were 68 bytes each — clearly corrupt placeholder files, not actual icons. Caused manifest errors in the console.
- **Fix:** Generated proper ORMA brand icon (blue background with "O" letter) and deployed to both icon paths.
- **Files:** `public/icon-192.png`, `public/icon-512.png`

### Dark Mode Search Page Sort Buttons Invisible — FIXED
- **Issue:** Sort buttons ("Recommended", "Newest", "Price ↑", etc.) on the search page lacked dark mode CSS classes. Text was `text-[#222222]` (dark) on a dark background = invisible.
- **Fix:** Added `dark:bg-white`, `dark:text-[#121212]`, `dark:border-white`, `dark:border-[#3D3D3D]`, and `dark:text-white` classes to active/inactive button states, filter chips, and "Clear All" text.
- **File:** `src/app/search/page.tsx`

### Location Prompt Uses window.confirm() — FIXED
- **Issue:** ORMA used an ugly `window.confirm()` browser dialog to ask for location permission, breaking the premium Apple-like aesthetic.
- **Fix:** Removed the `window.confirm()` call entirely. The browser's native geolocation permission dialog now handles the prompt seamlessly.
- **File:** `src/hooks/useUserLocation.ts`

### Content Security Policy Blocks Geolocation API — FIXED
- **Issue:** The CSP `connect-src` only allowed `self` and Supabase domains. The Nominatim reverse geocoding request to `nominatim.openstreetmap.org` was silently blocked.
- **Fix:** Added `https://nominatim.openstreetmap.org` to the `connect-src` directive.
- **File:** `next.config.ts`

## ✅ Fixed Bugs (Round 3)

### Search Suggestions Lag — FIXED
- **Issue:** The search autocomplete dropdown sometimes displays "Loading suggestions..." before populating.
- **Impact:** Medium. Degrades perceived performance.
- **Fix:** Added client-side caching using a Map to store suggestion results and reduced debounce timer from 300ms to 250ms for snappier responses.
- **File:** `src/components/SearchBar.tsx`

### Invalid Supabase Queries — FIXED
- **Issue:** Supabase fetches occasionally yield `400` errors on `GET .../rest/v1/listings?id=in.(...)` or `conversation_id=in.(...)`.
- **Cause:** Empty or invalid ID sequences during batch fetching.
- **Fix:** Added regex filtering (`uuidRegex`) to ensure only valid UUIDs are passed into `.in()` clauses for `RecentlyViewedSection.tsx` and `messageStore.ts`.
- **Files:** `src/components/home-sections/RecentlyViewedSection.tsx`, `src/store/messageStore.ts`

### Unsplash Image Load Failures
- **Issue:** Some listing images from Unsplash return `ERR_FAILED` or `404`.
- **Impact:** Medium — mitigated by `onError` fallback to placeholder SVG.
- **Status:** Mitigated.

### Manifest theme_color Inconsistency
- **Issue:** Was previously `#FF385C` (old coral), now corrected to `#0071E3` in a prior session.
- **Status:** Already fixed.

## ✅ Fixed Bugs (Round 4)

### Bookings Page StatusBadge Crash — FIXED
- **Issue:** Visiting `/bookings` crashes the application with `TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'icon')`.
- **Root Cause:** The `StatusBadge` component assumed `statusConfig[status]` would always return a valid object. If a booking contained an unknown, undefined, or missing status string, it crashed when trying to access `.icon`.
- **Fix:** Implemented a robust fallback object in `StatusBadge` that handles unknown statuses gracefully, preventing the page from crashing.
- **File:** `src/app/bookings/page.tsx`

### Strict Linter & React Hooks Violations — FIXED
- **Issue:** The application failed to compile cleanly due to unused imports, undefined variables, and a React Hooks violation.
- **Root Cause:** `useState` was called after an early `return` in the verification page, and missing lucide icons (`Star`, `Shield`) were causing undefined errors on the bookings page.
- **Fix:** Rearranged hook declarations in `src/app/verification/page.tsx` to abide by the Rules of Hooks, and added missing imports in `src/app/bookings/page.tsx`.
- **Files:** `src/app/verification/page.tsx`, `src/app/bookings/page.tsx`, `src/hooks/useInfiniteListings.ts`, `src/components/BookingWidget.tsx`

## 🐞 Discovered Bugs (Round 5 - Ongoing)

### Missing `listing_availability_blocks` Table
- **Issue:** On the listing details page, there is a `404` error in the console when the Supabase REST API attempts to fetch from `listing_availability_blocks`.
- **Impact:** Low. The page still loads correctly without crashing, but the booking widget or calendar component might be missing data.
- **Root Cause:** The `listing_availability_blocks` table likely doesn't exist in the database schema or there is a missing RLS policy.
- **Status:** To be fixed.
